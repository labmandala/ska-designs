                <h3>Research & Planning</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I began by researching, planning, and testing the design solutions to piece together. Brainstorming
                    goals for the website project I asked myself questions like: What is the purpose of the site? Who
                    are the people I really want to reach with my site? And, What are the 3 main actions I want these
                    users to take on my site? The first step was to plan out the website’s purpose and goals and figure
                    out what content to include. The purpose was to create a portfolio to showcase web development and
                    design work, promote related skills, and clearly express my personality and what I have to offer.
                </p>
                <p>Next was deciding what audience to connect with: individuals or employers for companies and small
                    businesses that I find most appealing. The primary actions would be for the audience to view my
                    work, to learn about my skills and areas of expertise, and to contact me to work with them. The main
                    end goal is to create a design comp using visual design fundamentals & tools that will effectively
                    communicate a unified, consistent visual message to a target audience.
                </p>
                <p>With goals in place and a better idea of the site's purpose, audience, and basic content needs, it
                    was time to create a content structure in order to help organize the user experience. But first I
                    created a mood board for inspiration, echoing the muted hues and calm vibe I wanted to touch on.

            <div>
                <p>Aside from structure and aesthetics, designing a website is also about creating an immersive
                    experience
                    for the user to transport them to their desired destination. The main goal here is to figure out
                    where
                    the user wants to go, and then get them there in as few steps as possible. Creating a user persona
                    would
                    help figure out the specific needs and interests of target users, providing a comprehensive view of
                    them, and a clear picture of the features needed for the site. Understanding who my users are and
                    what
                    their needs are, I can make sure that the site delivers on those needs.

                    <h4>User Flow</h4>
                    <p>Sitemapping organizes the site in an intuitive way, providing visual structure of sections and
                        planning the ideal path for users to navigate so that the most important content is easily
                        accessible. The hidden architecture of organized sitemaps ensure similar content is grouped
                        together
                        connecting information in the most effective way, and also improves search engine optimization,
                        or
                        SEO.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After mapping out the site, it was time to plan out the user flow to demonstrate the path the
                        user would take to get from one step to the next on the website. I want the user to have a
                        smooth and easy experience, finding exactly what they need on the site without having to click
                        around or search for it. The user flow was sketched out in a storyboard to help visualize each
                        step of my design concept, anticipating the steps a user would take, and to catch any problems
                        pre-design, aligning the site structure with its goals. This step is meant to help guide the
                        user to their destination in as few steps as possible.

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <p>Wireframes begin in low fidelity as a diagram of the basic structure of the web page showing
                        placeholders for the essential features, content, and functionality, so basically a skeleton.
                        The wireframe should support the UX work done so far, including the project goals, sitemap and
                        user flow. I created paper wireframe rough sketches to use as a reference template to build a
                        digital wireframe in Figma, and then recreated it with a higher level of detail using photoshop.
                    </p>
                    <p>The digital wireframes began as low fidelity as well, based off of the sketch. Using a method to
                        help neatly align the content and elements for a visually appealing layout, I applied a
                        twelve-column grid system to my design for positioning and alignment of content within that
                        framework. From there I began adding the content, colors and styles.

            <p>With the user experience planned, the site structure in place, and having learned about different types
                of design, I could now begin designing the look and feel, and brand personality. Although I intended to
                create a portfolio web design, I was also designing a personal brand from the ground up as part of that
                process. The look and feel refers to the overall aesthetic, mood, and tone of a brand. I wanted my look
                and feel to have a peaceful yet inviting mood with calm and soothing, muted colors, a clean professional
                look, and the techie vibe along with an earth element in the mix. I selected three images from my
                inspired collection and created a background collage for the hero header image. To tone things down I
                added a level of opacity.

                    <p>Understanding color theory fundamentals and some general color concepts help prepare me to create
                        the mood, tone, and styles I wanted. Exploring the way different colors relate to each other, or
                        color relationships, and common color schemes, I decided on a monochromatic scheme.
                    </p>
                    <p>For this project I was particularly drawn to one of my power colors, a teal blue-green, which I
                        toned down a little toward a grayish hue and then added a combination of grays. I wanted the
                        design to evoke a relaxed and trusting emotion and to communicate aspects of my personality to
                        the audience.

            <p>As a key component of the look and feel, I had to be selective about the typeface and fonts I chose. I
                played around with different font-pairings and to stick with the relaxed mood and to keep it modern I
                went with the pleasant sans serif font Merriweather Sans . I then mixed in its serif Merriweather
                version with slightly condensed letterforms to add a professional appeal to the site descriptions and to
                harmonize throughout the site.

            <h3>Design Patterns & Trends</h3>
            <br>
            <p>A set of guidelines on how to make sections of the user interface work well and look nice are found in UI
                design patterns. These design patterns were created to solve common user interface problems they may
                encounter throughout websites. To make sure users get what they need I incorporated some common design
                patterns, including the Home Link so that they can easily jump back home from another page by clicking
                the home link, and Input Prompts into the search fields to provide guidance for entering their text,
                without cluttering up the interface with extra instructions. For design layout and trends I went with a
                Full Screen Layout with the chosen imagery set in the background as an immersive full-screen display,
                the added opacity layer, and a splash of Big Typography for the compelling headline, although a little
                more subtle than some of the louder trends.

                    <p>The digital wireframe was styled into a mockup as a design comp in Photoshop. The design
                        went through a few versions and iterations throughout the process. Before packaging up the
                        files, I wanted to ensure all the details were in place and everything was organized by using a
                        final checklist:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is everything properly aligned?</li>
                        <li>Are fonts the right size and weight?</li>
                        <li>Is text spelled correctly with proper punctuation?</li>
                        <li>Are images and graphics the right size and shape?</li>
                        <li>Is the use of color consistent?</li>
                        <li>Are there any competing design elements or effects?</li>
                        <li>Is everything properly placed with plenty of white space?</li>
                        <li>Are there any design elements or final touches missing?</li>
                        <li>Does everything on the page need to be there?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Then I followed the steps of layer organization to finish up:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Delete any layers that are empty, hidden, duplicates, or no longer in use.</li>
                        <li>Name all layers in a way that makes sense to anyone that might being using the file.
                        </li>
                        <li>Make sure each design element has its own layer.</li>
                        <li>Organize the layers into logical folder groups (such as navigation or images).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>

            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <br>
            <p>As a bonus to exercise my developing web skills I decided to code up the design. An early version of the
                design was coded into a static website version as one of my first web development projects. I later
                learned new techniques, frameworks, tools and responsive, mobile-first web development and design, and I
                recreated the site into a fully responsive and mobile friendly version.
