                        else to take over the design and development of a brand and identity for her coffee shop that
                        fits her products and resonates within the neighborhood.

                    <h4>Personality & Identity</h4>
                    <p>A brand's personality and identity are connected on a deep level. The personality includes human
                        traits associated with it and the emotional connection formed with its audience, whereas the
                        brand's identity includes the image and message conveyed, as well as the communicated visuals
                        like logos, colors, and fonts. The key to sending the right message about the brand and the
                        first step toward creating an emotional connection with the audience is to make sure the brand
                        personality, colors, and typography all support each other, make sense, and tell a clear story.
                        Before building the brand personality profile, I developed a couple of target audience profiles
                        for an effective assessment by considering the product and service offerings, and the people
                        most interested in those offerings.

                <h4>Mission and Creative Brief</h4>
                <p>Composing a mission statement took some exploring of what exactly The Whole Bean does, understanding
                    the target audience, the reason for the service provided and how to best serve, the purpose for
                    being in the industry, why the business was started, and the desired brand image to convey. From
                    these details the brand purpose was summarized into a simple mission statement: <em>“To nourish and
                        inspire the body and mind.”</em>
                </p>
                <p>The creative brief helped to organize the scope of the project and also acted as a planning tool by
                    describing the goals and purpose, outlining the audience, budget, expectations surrounding
                    deadlines, and to clarify details prior to project work. It included the overall project scope,
                    specific goals and objectives, general client and target audience information, look and feel,
                    strategy, deliverables, and other important details.

            <h3>Holistic Identity Design</h3>
            <br>
            <p>After the preliminary research, planning and structuring the main characteristics of visual branding, it
                was
                time to translate the brand’s personality into a clear visual identity consistent across multiple
                platforms. The holistic set of designs to
                begin working with next for The Whole Bean’s identity system would include its color scheme, typescale,
                logo, icons, and imagery.

                    <p>Reviewing general color guidelines and how to stay in touch with audience
                        expectations, I chose to incorporate green into the color scheme with the dark
                        chocolate brown and neutral browns to accent. Green is
                        associated with: peaceful, growth, and health. The deep earth browns complement this and add
                        coffee shop vibes.

                    <h4>Typescale</h4>

                        the brand and support the its message. The typeface chosen is mostly sans serif with clean
                        edges, modern style, and stability, that works with an interesting display font that exudes
                        friendliness and uniqueness.

                    <h4>Logo & Icon Design</h4>
                    <p>An effective logo needs to blend seamlessly into a holistic identity system. Features of
                        effective logos include simplicity, being memorable, and versatility across platforms. A logo
                        should capture attention, engage the audience, and even create customer loyalty.
                    </p>
                    <p>I began design of the logo by brainstorming keywords for the brand personality, grouping them
                        into categories, viewing representative images, and then hand drawing some rough sketches for
                        the logo concept. Finally, I cleaned up my logo sketches into some final variations to
                        begin digital logo design.

                        a unique branding personality and the design of a complete collection of identity design
                        deliverables. I continued to utilize the style guide throughout completion of a Landing Page
                        design. This design process incorporated UX/UI design, layout trends, user testing, and other
                        industry standard tools, and supported the vision of The Whole Bean coffee shop as they prepared
                        to launch a grand opening.

                    <p>Previously I used branding psychology, creating a connection and a sense of loyalty among the
                        audience through brand personality and related components. Identity design deliverables included
                        a typescale, color scheme, collection of brand images, logo, icon pair, social media header and
                        brand style guide. With contemporary UX/UI design tools, software, and visual design skills, I
                        was able to plan the user experience for a professional sales landing page, prepare and organize
                        a successful brand launch, get feedback, iterate, and polish, prepare and package the final
                        design.

                        down-to-earth, warm, welcoming, peaceful, comforting, healthy and friendly with an artistic
                        edge. Its product line includes drip coffee and basic espresso drinks, a variety of loose leaf
                        teas, and simple food offerings such as seasonal fresh fruit and baked goods like muffins and
                        scones, as well as quick bites like veggie wraps, sandwiches, and granola bars. The menu is
                        completely plant-based with a focus on whole foods with gluten-free options.

                        landing page design in 3 weeks leaving 1 week to publish it and 1 month to promote it and build
                        excitement. Building from the created style guide, the client wanted a single web landing page
                        design
                        for the grand opening that would:

                            opening weekend. The decision was made to offer a promotion to entice customers to the shop
                            -- when they visit, they'll get a free cup of the shop's house blend organic coffee and a
                            raffle ticket in a drawing to win free coffee for a year!</li>
                        <li>Secondary goal: To form long-term relationships with potential customers, especially locals,
                            so the coffee shop is top of mind. The client’s decided to offer an instant downloadable
                            coupon for a free vegan chocolate muffin to anyone who signs up for the monthly newsletter.

                <h3>Landing Page Layout & Design</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The landing page layout and design offers information about the brand’s products and services while
                    motivating visitors to engage with the brand. The layout should provide a central one-stop web page
                    where people can go to learn more about a specific offering and connect with the brand in some way.
                    Landing pages can encourage a brand’s audience to buy a product, visit the business, sign up for a
                    mailing list or offer, follow the brand on social media, or any combination of these actions.
                </p>
                <p>Best practices for designing a pre-launch landing page include keeping it short and sweet, getting
                    right to the point, making the brand top of mind, adding social proof, applying consistent visual
                    messaging, using directional cues, and avoiding visual clutter.</p>

            <div>
                <p><strong>Successful pre-launch landing pages share 10 key features:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prominent logo.</strong> Feature the logo prominently to keep the focus on the brand.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Compelling main headline.</strong> Capture visitors' attention with an important
                        headline supporting the primary goals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Supporting subheading.</strong> Give a few more details about the main headline so
                        visitors don't have to search elsewhere.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engaging imagery.</strong> Use a key image or two to support the main headline, engage
                        visitors, and create an on-brand look and feel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call-to-action headline.</strong> Support the secondary goal and user actions with a
                        compelling headline or offer that visitors can't pass up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Straightforward forms & strong call-to-action button.</strong> Keep the form clean and
                        minimal, only ask for necessary information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Product & service offerings.</strong> Briefly highlight product or service offerings.
                        Include just enough information to pique interest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social proof.</strong> Be sure to include testimonials, reviews, and any feedback that
                        helps establish trust in the brand and its offerings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact information.</strong> Promote transparency by including the contact information,
                        including phone number, email, and address.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social media icons.</strong> Include links to social media accounts so friends and fans
                        can stay connected and follow what the brand is up to.</li>

                        <h4>Wireframing</h4>
                        <p>I began the wireframes as low fidelity sketches, then converted the selected versions from
                            paper
                            sketches to lo-fi digital wireframes in Figma. Next, I built on the digital wireframe,
                            re-creating the design in Photoshop, then adding design details to build the user interface
                            elements and design patterns into a higher fidelity wireframe. I iterated through a few
                            experimental versions of the webpage before deciding on a final one, then polishing the
                            features
                            of it.
