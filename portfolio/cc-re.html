                    <p>City Cycles is a bike rental shop in the downtown area of Riverside. Providing bike rentals
                        allows
                        customers to enjoy the experience of bike riding, reduce their carbon footprint by biking
                        instead of
                        driving for travel, and it provides convenience to explore the downtown area.

                        call in or come by the shop in-person to book their reservations. Unfortunately, this has
                        created a high number of phone calls and drop-ins, making it difficult for City Cycles to
                        provide quality customer service and causing an inconvenience for others who are trying to
                        book bike rentals.

                    <p>They aren’t sure why people aren’t booking online but they’d prefer more online reservations.
                        City Cycles needed help evaluating the UX of their existing website to uncover reasons
                        why their patrons aren’t using the website to book bike rentals.

                    <p>An introduction to the history behind the field of UX, understanding its evolution, exploring

                        respect to what kind of experience the user needed, wanted, and expected. I had to identify
                        target users and problems they might be facing, collect and analyze data through various
                        industry standard UX research methods, and connect the data to user problems to prioritize.

                    <p>In order to help find potential solutions to these problems for City Cycles and their users, I
                        performed various types of UX research and data collection techniques, including user survey
                        questionnaire creation, interpretation and review of website analytics, user interviewing and

            <p>Throughout the UX research process for City Cycles, I faced some challenges and obstacles. Luckily,
                I was able to use problem-solving skills to overcome any setbacks along the way, form a hypothesis,
                and
                continue working
                towards ideas and solutions.

                    <h4></h4>
                    <p>The biggest challenge I faced while conducting UX research was identifying exactly what was
                        preventing users from completing the reservation process through the City Cycles website and
                        why this was preventing them from returning to the website.

                        brainstorming solutions, by empathizing with the user, inductive and deductive reasoning,
                        interpreting data, and design thinking methodology.

                    <h4>Design Thinking</h4>
                    <p>Thinking back to the original problem statement, through structured brainstorming I
                        experimented
                        with different methods for design ideation. I explored divergent thinking to generate ideas
                        and
                        solutions through rough sketches using the Matrix Method, focusing on specific subsets of
                        the
                        problem, then mashing up the matrix ideas to create new concepts.
                    </p>
                    <p>After brainstorming and ideation, convergent thinking was needed to find patterns and
                        similarities among the ideas gathered, then group the ideas based upon those trends, and
                        finally
                        refine and narrow my main focus. Based on the gathered user data, I had to assess what
                        needed to
                        change, what could be implemented, and prioritize those needs accordingly.

            <h3>Results & Key Findings</h3>
            <br>
            <p>After performing research, collecting data, reviewing it for context, and analyzing the results, I found
                that users are frustrated with the City Cycles online reservation process and they are confused trying
                to navigate the site in general, witch they said was unclear. Two customers stated they always call to
                reserve because it’s the only real way to know they have a reservation, and another user said they felt
                misled. The data showed that users were relying heavily on the search bar to navigate rather than
                primary site navigation and the link to the phone number was the link with the highest traffic. Users
                overwhelmingly prefer to call in or drop by the shop, rather than struggle trying to figure out the
                reservation feature on the website.

                    <!--    <h4>Interpreting data</h4> -->
                    <p>City Cycles website analytics showed a consistent decrease in online bike rentals over the
                        course
                        of a year, and revealed that 85% of users were immediately leaving the site after
                        clicking the “Make a Reservation” link - a much higher rate than any other page on the site.
                        Site users expressed annoyance when their unused default email program unexpectedly opened
                        up
                        for a back and forth email reservation process, and closed out of it to instead call the
                        shop.

            <h3>Takeaways & Discoveries</h3>
            <br>
            <div>
                <p>One of the most interesting takeaways from the City Cycles UX research process was that most
                    users visiting the site are unique, first-time visitors. Data shows 74.2% are new site visitors,
                    while 25.8% are returning visitors. Since most of them never return to the site after the first
                    visit, a negative experience may be preventing them from returning and may be a contributing
                    factor to City Cycles declining online reservations, and even losing potential customers to
                    competitors.
                </p>
                <p>The existing frequent users want a recurring bike reservation feature on the site so that they
                    can
                    reserve bikes for more than one day, and the convenience to keep them overnight so they wouldn’t
                    have to go through the reservation process every day. They also want the ability to set up
                    reservations online in advance and manage them that way.
                </p>
                <p>Most of City Cycles users prefer bicycling because they enjoy the outdoors and are interested in
                    exploring the downtown area, they dislike traffic-congested commutes and road construction
                    delays,
                    and want to reduce their carbon footprint and consider biking to be a more eco-friendly way to
                    travel or commute.

            <h3>UX Recommendations</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Based on the UX research data, I recommend that City Cycles modify their homepage, including the
                navigation menu and reservation button, to clarify their message and purpose for users visiting
                their
                site. The reservation process needs to be improved so that it’s easier to use and more efficient,
                offering users a positive experience, so they will opt to reserve online instead of calling in, and
                will
                even want to return as a customer. The online feature should offer convenience for the customer to
                obtain a bike rental.

                        <li>Ensure the homepage reservation button is clear and prominent on the page.</li>
                        <li>Redesign the navigation menu to clarify and prioritize site purpose and content.</li>
                        <li>Implement a simple and efficient 3 or 4 step online reservation process.</li>
                        <li>Provide a prompt confirmation upon completion of successful reservation.</li>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <br>
            <p>As a continuation of this UX research project, my focus will shift into the realms of design, utilizing
                the tools, skills and fundamentals of information architectture, digital prototyping, wireframing,
                usability and universal design to create a high fidelity clickable prototype of a redesigned,
                UX-friendly City Cycles website.
