                        that are produced sustainably and ethically. Yolanda has designed four chairs so far, and feels
                        it’s the right time to launch her website. She needs someone to design a website to showcase her
                        new chair designs and allow customers to start pre-ordering them.

                        fair labor practices that ensure our employees have safe working conditions and are paid fairly

                    <h3>Research & Client Intake</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The target audience for the chairs strongly value sustainability as well as eco- and
                        ethically-produced goods. The client wants to ensure that her stylish chair designs entice
                        orders, but it's also important that the mission to support fair trade and fair labor resonates
                        with potential customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many of the competitors are big-box retailers (like IKEA) who often focus on either sustainably
                        sourced materials or fair labor. Sit Conmigo is unique in the furniture marketplace because they
                        focus on BOTH the source of materials and ethically building their chairs with fair labor.

                        <li>A Pre-order section that includes chair photos, product names, and links to pre-order the

                    <h3>Mobile First Approach</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Designing an online experience for mobile screens first, before designing it for larger screen
                        sizes, includes two steps: prioritizing the absolute must-have information and maximizing the
                        space on the mobile screen. This user friendly approach gives users the most important
                        information they’re looking for right away, without having to search for it. Progressive
                        enhancement meant building the smaller, mobile version first including essential features and
                        functions, then later expanding the design to larger and more advanced tablet and desktop
                        versions for optimal user experience. </p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The main challenge was in fitting all the content, information and design ideas into a small
                        space. Considering the main goals from the project brief, as well as additional client requests,
                        I was able to prioritize the most important content and position design requirements into the
                        layout accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Using condensed content and visual hierarchy, the mobile design uses a collapsed menu in the
                        corner, which upon clicking reveals a dropdown of the full navigation menu. That way, the
                        navigation keeps its importance, takes up less space, and makes room for other high-priority
                        content.

                <h4>Rapid Prototyping</h4>
                <p>Using the web design workflow, I reviewed the project brief and client information, goals and
                    requirements, visited websites that Yolanda shared for inspiration, created my mood board, began
                    sketches and layout of the mobile site structure, and compiled my style tile with colors and
                    typescale. After I made a brief sketch for the first mobile and tablet version of the site, I then
                    built an early wireframe version for each. With the top priority being pre-orders, I wanted to make
                    sure that call to action was evident and easily accessible throughout the design. Rather than
                    continuing sketching of each page layout and progressive wireframes in low fidelity, as I’ve done
                    with past designs, this time I began rapid prototyping toward high fidelity through digital design
                    and transferred the styles to subsequent device versions.</p>

                    <h4>Color Scheme</h4>
                    <p>I selected a color scheme with soothing colors representing trust, the earth element, eco-green
                        vision and echoing the Sit Conmigo philosophy. The deep blue-green teal as a primary color for
                        headings added a splash of exciting color, yet I kept plenty of whitespace so as not to detract
                        from the actual products. The neutral bamboo beige hue was integrated as a contrasting tone, yet
                        still complementing the primary color. A light blue monochrome hue was selected as an accent, as
                        well as almost black and almost white to be used for text and with backgrounds, when applicable.

                        space exists in-between elements, including text and images, in order to create a clean and
                        harmonious design that avoids cluttering elements together. The selected typeface and font
                        family traits represent the brand needs to match the traits of the brand personality and
                        support its message. The types chosen were modern, refined sans-serif with clean edges and
                        stability, as well as an interesting display font with a hint of excitement and uniqueness.

                    <p>Rapid prototyping towards high fidelity mockups I began applying the colors, typefaces, and
                        visual
                        elements, including logo, icons and photos, to the mobile design comp. To create a cohesive,
                        unified
                        design, the same visual elements were then applied to the tablet and desktop comps. The main
                        difference
                        between the mobile, tablet, and desktop comps will be the size and placement of the copy and
                        visual
                        elements. Maintaining a consistent look and feel, the arrangement of elements between each comp
                        would
                        vary subtly.

                    <p>With the desktop version I was able to add a couple extra elements I had been inspired to,
                        including an expanded collage with some images I selected for my mood board as a reflection 
                        of the process and to
                        highlight that aspect of Sit Conmigo’s mission and commitment to fair trade. Understanding the
                        customer
                        and the company’s goals and mission, I was able to incorporate brand psychology to establish an
                        overall
                        personality with strategic use of color, typography, imagery, and iconography.
