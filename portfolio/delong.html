                    <p>Dorothy DeLong- a traveling feminist photographer who explores the country in search of women
                        doing amazing things. Dorothy captures their boldness in action, whether protesting for pay
                        equality, fighting for environmental regulation, or standing up for those in the #MeToo
                        movement.

                        portfolio for museums interested in her work. Dorothy wants a portfolio website to display her
                        work so that galleries and magazines can see her photography at a glance and request to use it.

                        <li>Step 3. Add detail to the design</li>
                        <li>Step 4. Create a final design comp</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>The first step was gathering information in order to get to know the client, understand the main
                        goals of the site, her style, needs, and any parameters to keep in mind for the design.
                    </p>
                    <p>After an introduction to Dorothy and her goals, I sought out inspiration to encourage the
                        creative process. I compiled an inspirational mood board, browsed related sites, and took a
                        moment to reflect on the project. Gathering one’s thoughts, feelings, and intentions at the
                        start of a project is useful for maintaining scope and providing guidance along the way.

                        <li>The website should entice magazines to purchase her photos for publication. She wants a good
                            place to showcase her work when magazines ask for a portfolio.</li>
                        <li>It should help get her work shown in museums, both locally and abroad. A great portfolio
                            site would allow her work to be shown much more widely.</li>

                                <li>An artist’s statement, which will help visitors of the site learn more about Dorothy

                                <li>A photo or headshot of Dorothy</li>
                                <li>A quote about her mission</li>

                    <h4>Conducting Research</h4>
                    <p>I reviewed her goals and parameters and assessed her responses to a project
                        intake questionnaire:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Who are you trying to reach with this website?</li>

                        <li>What are some website designs that inspire you?</li>
                        <li>Can I see some of your work samples?</li>
                        <li>Do you have a logo, specific colors, or any other content I should include on the site?
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                <br>
                <div class="col-lg-7">
                    <p>The responses provided me with helpful information on her target audience- usually magazines that
                        want to use her work in editorials and galleries that want to show her work. She wanted to make
                        it really easy for both of these people to find what they need from her site. Her competitors
                        include others in the same niche of photography, exhibiting artistic feminism and bold street
                        shots.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was able to see some design examples of what she liked and discovered she was very inspired by
                        Bettye Lane’s work as a photographer, and looked up to her as a role model. I also viewed
                        several samples of Dorothy’s own work. Her style varies from street and candid shots to more
                        staged ones and her photos tend to center around either feminism in action or feminism in
                        moments. I was provided with photography samples and her personal logo.

                        structure, intuitive navigation and a consistent layout, all working in tandem. Organizing the
                        site into
                        a logical structure, I worked with concepts like visual hierarchy and content
                        prioritization.
                        The user’s attention should be drawn to the most important content first, information that
                        visitors
                        would generally be looking for when they visit.

                    <h4>Mobile First & Content Prioritization</h4>
                    <p>The Mobile First mindset is a responsive design approach that starts with prioritizing content
                        and
                        then
                        maximizing the space on the screen. To maximize space, one option would be to use a collapsed
                        menu
                        icon
                        for the navigation menu. Design work starts out low fidelity, meaning the initial hand-drawn
                        sketches
                        contain very little detail, and are simply to organize the order of content into a basic
                        skeleton of
                        what the site might look like. With consideration of the goals and parameters, I could determine
                        what
                        information should be most prominent and what would be less emphasized.

                    <h4>Digital Wireframing & Styles</h4>
                    <p>The digital wireframes began as low fidelity structures from the sketch. Using a method to help
                        neatly align the content and elements for a visually appealing layout, I applied a twelve-column
                        grid system to my design for positioning and alignment of content within that framework.

                        layout. This
                        way, Dorothy’s work would be front and center right from the start for a compelling
                        introduction,
                        emphasizing her photography. I would include her logo and full name at the top for instant
                        branding and
                        identity, as well as her Artist’s Statement in the top header section as prioritized content
                        about her.
                    </p>

                    <p>Color can be a powerful design element of the storytelling process, communicating messages,
                        eliciting feelings, and assisting in creating visual hierarchy. After exploring color theory and
                        various color relationships, I played with hue, saturation, and value, as well as contrast. I
                        settled on a magenta hue for a powerful splash of boldness with a feminine edge. Outside of
                        black and white, I stuck to a three-color scheme for this project to create visual interest and
                        variety without becoming busy or distracting.
                    </p>
                    <p>Next was selecting typography and using it establish visual hierarchy, ensuring it expressed tone
                        and mood, and complemented the overall design. I experimented with different font-pairings on
                        digital artboards before deciding on the main typefaces for Dorothy’s style tile, keeping in
                        line with her style and goals. I created a custom typescale as a guide for all the sizes,
                        typefaces, and transformations throughout the site.

                    <h4>Versions & Revisions</h4>
                    <p>Moving from low-fidelity towards high-fidelity digital designs, means adding lots of detail for a
                        higher-quality appearance. This includes graphics, images, colors, and typography, all working
                        well together.
                    </p>
                    <p>Dorothy’s profile samples had some variance and yet commonality with her own unique style and
                        balanced
                        blend of black and white statements juxtaposed alongside splashes of colorfully candid images. I
                        needed
                        to differentiate her portfolio from her competitors and to keep her parameters in mind.

                    <h4>UI & Intuitive Design</h4>
                    <p>The content structure was designed to help users easily find what they need. Understanding design
                        patterns and trends that help produce an intuitive user interface, a trend I
                        used here was applying an opacity filter to the background feature image, which made the text
                        easier
                        to read. As an intuitive design feature, I applied magenta from the color scheme to the
                        navigation links to imitate what Dorothy’s site will look like when a user hovers their mouse on
                        the About navigation button.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8">
                    <p>So far I’ve performed research to determine site goals, brainstormed ideas, created wireframes,
                        and
                        built
                        a design comp. At this stage in the iteration cycle it’s best to get feedback from others
                        invested
                        in
                        the design, like the client, customer, a project stakeholder, or potential site users before
                        launching.
                        Then interpret the feedback for understanding, and implement any relevant changes or necessary
                        revisions
                        based on the feedback that aligns with the project goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>To make sure the original objectives were met and to ensure the success of the site, I presented
                        the
                        project to gather information for feedback to help determine whether more iteration was needed.

                    <h4>Obstacles & Challenges</h4>
                    <p>Aside from determining content prioritization, maximizing space for mobile versions, design
                        decisions,
                        and minor revisions for versioning throughout the project, there was one small challenge towards
                        the
                        end
                        of the project’s iteration cycle.
                    </p>
                    <p>Feedback requested was to add in two new images as thumbnails to the gallery, and an additional
                        social
                        media icon for another profile link. I used my design knowledge and skills to do a little
                        re-structuring
                        to
                        incorporate these revisions into a new version and delivered again for further feedback.

                    <br>

                    <h4>File Preparation & Final Steps</h4>
                    <p>Once the design comp was complete, I did a final walk through for review, ensuring all goals and
                        parameters were met, visual messaging cohesion, and that look and feel were on point for
                        Dorothy’s personal photography brand. Finally, in preparing files for the next steps I made sure
                        the files and folders were properly named and structured, and that everything was well-organized
                        and labeled.
