                    <p>Creation of a modern microsite for a great cause and an important environmental movement.
                        Requirement was to create an informative, engaging and professional looking digital platform for
                        Earth Hour; an annual environmental movement. The UI design must be modern and eye-catching but
                        simple for a quick yet effective message delivery.

                    <p>1.5 days to complete. This gave me enough time to gather inspiration and imagery, and then focus 
                        on developing my theme. With limited time I had to
                        be disciplined with the ideas I was creating and be selective with exploration, keeping things
                        simple and sticking to the main message.

                    <p>Earth Hour began as a symbolic lights out event in Sydney, Australia in 2007, and soon became one
                        of the world’s largest environmental grassroots movements. Now, every year millions of people
                        are inspired to take positive action for our planet.

                    <p>People from all around the world have joined this movement to take part in Earth Hour. They do a
                        wide range of activities over the hour to show reverence for our planet’s future. Many choose to
                        be a part of Earth Hour simply by turning their lights out for one hour from 8.30pm – 9:30pm
                        local time, as a symbolic show of solidarity for the planet.

                    <p>To spread the word of this great environmental movement, and to encourage people to get involved,
                        an Earth Hour microsite was designed. A microsite is basically a small, often one page, website
                        which functions as a supplement to a primary website. In this case, the idea is for the
                        microsite to be housed on the main WWF website.

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>Alongside the process of gathering imagery into a mood board, I was reminded of a beautiful and
                thoughtful poem I had come across previously. I felt the following poem echoed the message and was
                suitable for the event, and so I really wanted to share it somehow along with the design as its own
                inspirational art form in compelling words.</p>

                <h3>Keeping Quiet</h3><br>

                <p>Now we will count to twelve<br>
                    and we will all keep still.<br>
                    For once on the face of the earth<br>
                    let’s not speak in any language,<br>
                    let’s stop for one second,<br>
                    and not move our arms so much.<br>
                    It would be an exotic moment<br>
                    without rush, without engines,<br>
                    we would all be together<br>
                    in a sudden strangeness.<br>
                    Fishermen in the cold sea<br>
                    would not harm whales<br>
                    and the man gathering salt<br>
                    would look at his hurt hands.<br>
                    Those who prepare green wars,<br>
                    wars with gas, wars with fire,<br>
                    victory with no survivors,<br>
                    would put on clean clothes<br>
                    and walk about with their brothers<br>
                    in the shade, doing nothing.<br>
                    What I want should not be confused<br>
                    with total inactivity.<br>
                    Life is what it is about;<br>
                    I want no truck with death.<br>
                    If we were not so single-minded<br>
                    about keeping our lives moving,<br>
                    and for once could do nothing,<br>
                    perhaps a huge silence<br>
                    might interrupt this sadness<br>
                    of never understanding ourselves<br>
                    and of threatening ourselves with death.<br>
                    Perhaps the earth can teach us<br>
                    as when everything seems dead<br>
                    and later proves to be alive.<br>
                    Now I’ll count up to twelve<br>
                    and you keep quiet and I will go.</p>

                    <h4>Color Scheme</h4>
                    <p>For the color scheme I wanted an earth blue hue with nearly black and white. I liked the idea of
                        a dark theme for the ‘lights out’ aspect and to reflect the nighttime. I also decided to
                        incorporate plenty of contrast, which I used to help separate the navigational sections. Once
                        I had colors in mind and some imagery inspiration, I eyedropped colors from the images.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Typography</h4>
                    <p>The typeface I selected had a unique, digital edginess to it, but still had some smooth lines and
                        was clean and reader friendly enough to work with paragraph text. After playing with a few
                        options, I settled on fonts from a single typeface that I liked across the site, including extra
                        large and various sized headings, capitalized for navigations, and smaller button text.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Buttons</h4>
                    <p>I experimented with different sized buttons, the font size within, and then the actual color. The
                        final design has default black button backgrounds, with the active state in white. </p>

            <br>
            <p>The visual contrast assisted in catching attention and I incorporated some other-worldly images, bringing
                the user’s attention to the movement and theme ideas. Since the request was for a micro site and with a
                strict timeframe, and also to keep things clean and the message clear, I limited the displayed
                information on the page and provided call to action linked buttons for the users to visit different
                sections of the the main WWF’s website further to get ideas and tips, explore their social media pages,
                share the event with others, and to access more information on the movement. This would also help the
                organization to receive more traffic from interested visitors and potentially allow them to discover
                other areas of concern and even to visit relevant partners or causes, amplifying the mission. </p>
