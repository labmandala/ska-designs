                        else to take over the design and development of a brand and identity for her coffee shop that
                        fits her products and resonates within the neighborhood.

                    <h4>Personality & Identity</h4>
                    <p>A brand's personality and identity are connected on a deep level. The personality includes human
                        traits associated with it and the emotional connection formed with its audience, whereas the
                        brand's identity includes the image and message conveyed, as well as the communicated visuals
                        like logos, colors, and fonts. The key to sending the right message about the brand and the
                        first step toward creating an emotional connection with the audience is to make sure the brand
                        personality, colors, and typography all support each other, make sense, and tell a clear story.
                        Before building the brand personality profile, I developed a couple of target audience profiles
                        for an effective assessment by considering the product and service offerings, and the people
                        most interested in those offerings.

                <h4>Mission and Creative Brief</h4>
                <p>Composing a mission statement took some exploring of what exactly The Whole Bean does, understanding
                    the target audience, the reason for the service provided and how to best serve, the purpose for
                    being in the industry, why the business was started, and the desired brand image to convey. From
                    these details the brand purpose was summarized into a simple mission statement: <em>“To nourish and
                        inspire the body and mind.”</em>
                </p>
                <p>The creative brief helped to organize the scope of the project and also acted as a planning tool by
                    describing the goals and purpose, outlining the audience, budget, expectations surrounding
                    deadlines, and to clarify details prior to project work. It included the overall project scope,
                    specific goals and objectives, general client and target audience information, look and feel,
                    strategy, deliverables, and other important details.

            <h3>Holistic Identity Design</h3>
            <br>
            <p>After the preliminary research, planning and structuring the main characteristics of visual branding, it
                was
                time to translate the brand’s personality into a clear visual identity consistent across multiple
                platforms. The holistic set of designs to
                begin working with next for The Whole Bean’s identity system would include its color scheme, typescale,
                logo, icons, and imagery.

                    <h4>Color Scheme</h4>
                    <p>Reviewing general color guidelines and how to stay in touch with audience
                        expectations, I chose to incorporate green into the color scheme with the dark
                        chocolate brown and neutral browns to accent. Green is
                        associated with: peaceful, growth, and health. The deep earth browns complement this and add
                        coffee shop vibes.

                    <h4>Typescale</h4>

                        the brand and support the its message. The typeface chosen is mostly sans serif with clean
                        edges, modern style, and stability, that works with an interesting display font that exudes
                        friendliness and uniqueness.

                    <h4>Logo & Icon Design</h4>
                    <p>An effective logo needs to blend seamlessly into a holistic identity system. Features of
                        effective logos include simplicity, being memorable, and versatility across platforms. A logo
                        should capture attention, engage the audience, and even create customer loyalty.
                    </p>
                    <p>I began design of the logo by brainstorming keywords for the brand personality, grouping them
                        into categories, viewing representative images, and then hand drawing some rough sketches for
                        the logo concept. Finally, I cleaned up my logo sketches into some final variations to
                        begin digital logo design.

                    <p>The imagery should evoke vibes consistent with the brand aspects: friendly, peaceful,
                        healthy,
                        welcoming, convey comfort. The tone of voice should support adjacent content: sincere, kind,
                        healthy, warm. For the audience response I want to build trust and loyalty, for them to feel
                        welcome, comfortable, safe, healthy, alive, nourished, and embraced by compassion. The
                        composition
                        should be clear and Images should complement the brand's logo, color scheme, and typography.

                        the grand opening for the coffee shop is in place. In anticipation, the next project lined up is
                        to
                        design a web landing page. The branding concept is ready to be transformed into a
